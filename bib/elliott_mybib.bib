                  Domain},
  publisher =    {Oxford University Press},
  abstract =     {This book brings together novel work on the semantics and
                  pragmatics of certain indefinite expressions that also convey
                  modality. These epistemic indefinites are determiners or
                  pronouns that signal ignorance on the part of the speaker,
                  such as German irgendein and Spanish algun the sentence Maria
                  se caso con algun medico ('Maria married some doctor or
                  other') both makes an existential statement that there is a
                  doctor that Maria married and signals the speaker's inability
                  or unwillingness to identify the doctor in question. Although
                  epistemic indefinites have featured in recent semantic
                  literature, a full understanding of the phenomenon is still
                  lacking: there is currently no agreement on the source of
                  their epistemic component; there is insufficient
                  cross-linguistic data to develop a semantic typology of these
                  items; and the parallelisms and differences between epistemic
                  indefinites and other expressions that convey epistemic
                  modality have not been explored in depth. In this volume, a
                  team of experts in the field offer novel empirical
                  observations and important theoretical insights on epistemic
                  indefinites and related topics such as modal free relatives,
                  modified numerals, and epistemic modals. They provide a
                  coherent overview of the issues that shape the subject as well
                  as placing them in the context of current semantic research,
                  moving towards the development of a semantic typology of
                  epistemic indefinites that explores the place of these
                  expressions within a general typology of modal items.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a semantically-based solution to the problem of predicting whether a verb will display the subjective conjugation or the objective conjugation in Hungarian. This alternation correlates with the definiteness of the object, but definiteness is not a completely reliable indicator of the subjective/objective alternation, nor is specificity. A prominent view is that the subjective/objective alternation is conditioned by the syntactic category of the object, but this view has also been shown to be untenable. This paper offers a semantic solution: If the referential argument of a phrase is lexically specified as familiar/new, then the phrase bears the feature [+{DEF}]/[−{DEF}], and this feature governs the conjugations. The notions of novelty and familiarity are made precise using a compositional version of {DRT} in the context of a suitably large fragment of Hungarian, including local and non-local personal pronouns, demonstratives, definite and indefinite articles, quantifiers, wh-words, numerals, and possessives.},

Terje Lohndal's core claim is that it is possible to create a transparent mapping from syntax to logical form such that each syntactic Spell-Out domain directly corresponds to a conjunct at logical form. The argument focuses on two domains of grammar - phrase structure and argument structure - and brings together two independently established but seemingly unconnected hypotheses: that verbs do not require arguments, and that specifiers are not required by the grammar. Following the introduction, the second chapter looks in detail at the separation of the verb from its thematic arguments, and presents data from argument structure, reciprocals, and adjectival passives, while the third examines the claim that specifiers do not play a role as the target of various grammatical operations. Chapter 4 then brings these arguments together and proposes a syntax that maps transparently onto logical forms where all thematic arguments are severed from the verb. Moreover, the broader consequences of this approach are outlined in terms of Spell-Out, movement, linearization, thematic uniqueness, and agreement. The book closes with an examination of the relationship between grammatical and conceptual meaning, and a detailed discussion of the nature of compositionality.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/40284312},
	shorttitle = {Making a Pronoun},
	abstract = {This article argues that natural languages have two binding strategies that create two types of bound variable pronouns. Pronouns of the first type, which include local fake indexicals, reflexives, relative pronouns, and {PRO}, may be born with a "defective" feature set. They can acquire the features they are missing (if any) from verbal functional heads carrying standard X-operators that bind them. Pronouns of the second type, which include long-distance fake indexicals, are born fully specified and receive their interpretations via context-shifting X-operators (Cable 2005). Both binding strategies are freely available and not subject to syntactic constraints. Local anaphora emerges under the assumption that feature transmission and morphophonological spell-out are limited to small windows of operation, possibly the phases of Chomsky 2001. If pronouns can be born underspecified, we need an account of what the possible initial features of a pronoun can be and how it acquires the features it may be missing. The article develops such an account by deriving a space of possible paradigms for referential and bound variable pronouns from the semantics of pronominal features. The result is a theory of pronouns that predicts the typology and individual characteristics of both referential and bound variable pronouns.},

	url = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/77805},
	abstract = {This thesis investigates three topics relating to the semantics of phi features on pronouns. Part I focuses on gender features on pronouns. Following previous studies (Cooper 1983, Heim \& Kratzer 1998), I claim that they are presupposition triggers. Based on this assumption, I show that predicates containing bound gendered pronouns have an assertive meaning that does not entail the gender presupposition, and further point out that such predicates pose a serious challenge for existing theories of presupposition projection, especially with respect to quantified sentences. A conclusion drawn from this discussion is that the presupposition needs to be dissociated from the assertive meaning, as in Karttunen \& Peters's (1979) two dimensional theory. However, such a theory is known to run into the so-called binding problem in quantified sentences. I propose a solution to the binding problem using the mechanism of cross-sentential anaphora, and show that the resulting theory nicely accounts for the projection properties of various quantificational determiners. Part {II} discusses the interpretation of person and number features on bound pronouns. It is known that some occurrences of phi features on bound pronoun behave as if they are semantically inert (Heim 2008b, Jacobson to appear, Kratzer 1998a, 2009, Partee 1989). One popular account of this phenomenon, the minimal pronoun account, claims that such phi features are purely morphological, and postulates a {PF} operation that transmits phi features of a binder onto each pronoun that it binds (Heim 2008b, Kratzer 1998a, 2009). I put forward an alternative account that dispenses with the {PF} operation, and instead puts most of the burden on syntax, by encoding more information in the indices than standardly assumed. As a result, all occurrences of phi features are semantically relevant. I offer both empirical and conceptual arguments for the proposed account over the minimal pronoun account. Part {III} deals with the phenomenon of indexical shifting where person features are systematically affected (Anand 2006, Anand \& Nevins 2004, Schlenker 1999, 2003b). I discuss novel data from Uyghur and Japanese as well as data drawn from previous studies, particularly focusing on the universals and variation within and across languages.},

	abstract = {It is a cross-linguistically robust fact that the same modal auxiliaries come in different flavors: epistemic, deontic, ability, teleological... This fact is neatly captured in a system where each modal has a single lexical entry, where the difference in flavor comes from contextually-provided accessibility relations (cf. Lewis 1973, Kratzer 1981). Equally robust, however, are the phenomena that suggest that epistemics and a subset of deontics are interpreted higher than the remaining flavors (subsumed under the label 'root modals'). The goal of this dissertation is to show that a unified analysis of modal auxiliaries is maintainable, while still providing some principled explanation for the relative ordering of tense, aspect and the various modals in Cinque's (1999) hierarchy, based on evidence in French and Italian. To make sense of the relative scope of modals w.r.t. tense and aspect, I start with the empirical puzzle that aspect interacts differently with the various modal flavors. Perfective aspect on roots in French and Italian yields 'actuality entailments' (cf. Bhatt 1999), that is, an uncancelable inference that the proposition expressed by the complement holds in the actual world, and not merely in some possible world(s).},

  Abstract                 = {Correlativization seems to be an intrinsicallynon-local strategy, where the Correlative clause can appeardiscontinuous from the noun phrase it modifies. I show that correlative constructions in the Modern Indo-Aryan languages neverthelessdisplay locality effects.The nature of these locality effects depends upon whether the correlativeclause involves a single relativization ('Simple') or mutiplerelativizations ('Multi-Head'). The generalization that emerges is thata Correlative clause must be merged as locally as possible to the phrasethat it modifies. Simple correlatives modify {DPs} and so they startadjoined to the {DP} that they modify and then are fronted to an {IP}-adjoinedposition. Such an approach is able to explain the hitherto unexplainedsensitivity of the correlative-modified phrase relationship to islands.Multi-Head Correlatives modify {IPs} and therefore they start adjoined to the {smallestIP} that contains the variables bound by the Multi-Head Correlative, followedby optional movement to the clause-initial position. My proposal argues that Simple Correlatives and Multi-Head Correlatives involve different derivational histories. This difference in derivationalhistory is then used to account for the many differences in their syntactic behavior. Finally, the 'Condition on Local Merge' from which this analysis follows is shown to have cross-linguistic support.},

	abstract = {In this article, we argue for the existence of covert pied-piping in wh-questions through a previously unnoticed pattern of intervention effects in Superiority-obeying English multiple wh-questions. We show that the preference of covert pied-piping, unlike that of overt pied-piping, is for movement of larger constituents. We argue that this discrepancy stems from conflicting requirements of {PF} and {LF}: overt pied-piping feeds both {LF} and {PF}, but covert pied-piping feeds {LF} only. The study of covert pied-piping thus reveals the true preference of {LF} and narrow syntax with regard to pied-piping: larger pied-piping constituents are preferred over smaller ones. This preference can be overridden by certain {PF} constraints that apply to overt pied-piping.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a pair-list reading which we call the trapped pair-list reading, arising in long distance questions with three wh-phrases, two of which are embedded within a subordinate clause. Under the trapped pair-list reading, all three whs are answered, but only the two whs trapped inside the embedded clause can be paired. Based on evidence from a language with (overt) multiple wh-movement (Romanian), we argue that (lists of) trapped pair-list readings in English involve covert multiple partial wh-movement. On this proposal, trapped pair-list readings raise, for multiple partial wh-movement, the same canonical scope paradox that single partial wh-movement raises, since on the relevant list reading, all three whs have semantically wide, matrix scope, though syntactically, the (only) two whs that can be paired are trapped at the periphery of the subordinate clause. We suggest that this paradox can be resolved by extending Sternefeld (2001) and Lipták and Zimmermann's (2007) Indirect Dependency Approach to single partial-movement to multiple partial-movement. The basic insight driving this proposal is that the subordinate whs can be paired independently of the matrix wh because the subordinate clause can be interpreted as a multiple question on its own.},

	abstract = {The paper provides a semantic analysis of intervention effects in wh-questions. The interpretation component of the grammar derives uninterpretability, hence ungrammaticality, of the intervention data. In the system of compositional interpretation that I suggest, wh-phrases play the same role as focused phrases, introducing alternatives into the computation. Unlike focus, wh-phrases make no ordinary semantic contribution. An intervention effect occurs whenever a focus-sensitive operator other than the question operator tries to evaluate a constituent containing a wh-phrase. It is argued that this approach can capture the universal as well as the crosslinguistically variable aspects of intervention effects, in a way that is superior to previous approaches. Further consequences concern other focus-related constructions: multiple focus data, {NPI} licensing, and alternative questions.},

	abstract = {In many natural languages, there are clear syntactic and/or intonational differences between declarative sentences, which are primarily used to provide information, and interrogative sentences, which are primarily used to request information. Most logical frameworks restrict their attention to the former. Those that are concerned with both usually assume a logical language that makes a clear syntactic distinction between declaratives and interrogatives, and usually assign different types of semantic values to these two types of sentences. A different approach has been taken in recent work on inquisitive semantics. This approach does not take the basic syntactic distinction between declaratives and interrogatives as its starting point, but rather a new notion of meaning that captures both informative and inquisitive content in an integrated way. The standard way to treat the logical connectives in this approach is to associate them with the basic algebraic operations on these new types of meanings. For instance, conjunction and disjunction are treated as meet and join operators, just as in classical logic. This gives rise to a hybrid system, where sentences can be both informative and inquisitive at the same time, and there is no clearcut division between declaratives and interrogatives. It may seem that these two general approaches in the existing literature are quite incompatible. The main aim of this paper is to show that this is not the case. We develop an inquisitive semantics for a logical language that has a clearcut division between declaratives and interrogatives. We show that this language coincides in expressive power with the hybrid language that is standardly assumed in inquisitive semantics, we establish a sound and complete axiomatization for the associated logic, and we consider a natural enrichment of the system with presuppositional interrogatives.},

It is also proposed, however, that these two types of {NPIs} pay attention to different aspects of the meaning of their environment. As observed by von Fintel and Chierchia, weak {NPIs} do not attend to the scalar implicatures of presuppositions of their licensers. Strong {NPIs} see both the truth-conditional and non-truth-conditional (scalar implications, presuppositions) meaning of their licensers. This theory accounts for the puzzling inability, noted by Rullmann and Gajewski, of Strawson anti-additive operators to license strong {NPIs}, as well as for the effects of Zwarts’s hierarchy of negative strength. Additional issues concerning comparative quantifiers, few, and proportional quantifiers are addressed.},

We argue that in both cases the alternatives are determined in the same way, as a contextual restriction of the focus value of the sentence, which, in turn, is defined in structure-sensitive terms. We provide evidence that contextual restriction is subject to a constraint that prevents it from discriminating between alternatives when they stand in a particular logical relationship with the assertion or the prejacent, a relationship that we refer to as symmetry. Due to this constraint on contextual restriction, discriminating between alternatives in cases of symmetry becomes the task of focus values. This conclusion is incompatible with standard type-theoretic definitions of focus values, motivating our structure-sensitive definition instead.},

Previous accounts have suggested that the relevant distinction is between different kinds of heads, such that some heads in the ellipsis site may mismatch while others may not, and they have dealt with this sensitivity to a set of “special heads” with a built-for-purpose syntactic identity condition which holds over and above semantic identity to constrain ellipsis. In this article I argue against this approach and pursue an alternative which holds that identity is syntactic but “loose” in a precisely defined way. I show that the relevant generalization that accounts for syntactic identity effects in sluicing and {VP}-ellipsis-like constructions concerns the position of variables in the antecedent, rather than the feature content of syntactic heads. I propose an implementation of syntactic identity which allows for the accommodation of additional antecedents, with these being derived by a grammatical algorithm for generating alternatives, and I show that this implementation derives the right kinds of looseness while restricting mismatches with respect to the position of variables, thus deriving both the tolerable and intolerable mismatches between E and A without recourse to a specific condition regulating the content of special heads.},

I provide new data that pose a challenge to the use of monotonicity and that support the structure-sensitive definition.

This paper investigates a complex array of facts in this domain that shows that attributive comparatives, unlike other comparatives, are well-formed only if some type of ellipsis operation applies within the comparative clause. Incorporating data from English, Polish, Czech, Greek, and Bulgarian, we argue that these facts support two important conclusions. First, violations of Ross's Left Branch Condition that involve attributive modifiers should not be accounted for in terms of constraints on {LF} representations (such as the Empty Category Principle), but rather in terms of the principle of Full Interpretation at the {PF} interface. Second, ellipsis must be analyzed as deletion of syntactic material from the phonological representation. In addition, we present new evidence from pseudogapping constructions that favors an articulated syntax of attributive modification in which certain types of attributive modifiers may occur outside {DP}.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel semantic analysis of the quantificational variability data discovered by Berman (1991). We suggest that the adverb of quantification in those data quantifies over semantic questions. Its domain is a division of the original question into subquestions, where a legitimate division into subquestions is one in which each member contributes towards the answer to the original question, and together the answers to all subquestions provide the complete answer to the original question. Thus the question itself is associated with a part/whole structure, based on information. We show that there are quantificational variability effects in which the matrix verb is exclusively question‐embedding. These data pose a problem for other theories of quantificational variability in questions (specifically Berman 1991 and Lahiri 2002) and motivate our analysis. There are other desirable consequences of our theory, including flexibility in what counts as a subquestion and flexibility in what counts as a complete answer. Beyond quantificational variability, associating questions with a part/whole structure receives independent motivation from questions that occur in collective and cumulative embedded contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {Under what conditions are expressions of a language the same; when are they different? Indices and Identity focuses on this question in the context of the theory of anaphora and on the role of indices in characterizing syntactic and semantic identity of expressions.Fiengo and May develop two main themes within the theory of anaphora. The first pertains to the meaning of coindexing and non-coindexing -- the correspondence between indexical relations among expressions and the valuation relation that holds among them -- while the second is the development of Dependency Theory, the theory of the relations of occurrences of indices. The novelty of Fiengo and May's approach lies with their characterization of indexical dependencies and the conditions under which structures manifest the same or different dependency.In particular, Indices and Identity emphasizes issues raised by strict and sloppy identity in ellipsis, exploring what Fiengo and May call "the eliminative puzzles of ellipsis." The significance of these puzzles is that they show the shortcomings of current theories of anaphora in ellipsis, while illustrating an application of Dependency Theory to complex cases of strict and sloppy identity.Elliptical contexts in turn lead to consideration of the embedding of the formal syntactic notions of identity arising from indices and dependencies within more general notions of structural identity. This relates to a consideration of the foundations of reconstruction, which, the authors argue, is syntactic identity up to indexical identity and vehicle change -- variation in the syntactic form of expression of arguments.The book concludes with a discussion of the relation of reconstruction, logical representation in grammar, and the application of grammatical constraints. The discussion focuses on antecedent contained deletion, and stands independently as a comprehensive study of this construction.Linguistic Inquiry Monograph No. 24},

Its reformulation of how grammar and lexicon interact has profound implications for linguistic, philosophical, and psychological theories about human mind and language.Hagit Borer departs from both constructional approaches to syntax and the long generative tradition that uses the word as the nucleus around which the syntax grows. She argues that the hierarchical, abstract structures of language are universal, not language specific, and that language variation emerges from the morphological and phonological properties of inflectional material.In Name Only applies this radical approach to nominal structure. Integrating research in syntax, semantics, and morphology, the author argues that nominal structure is based on the syntactic realization of semantic notions such as classifier, quantity, and reference. In the process she seeks to do away with lexical ambiguity and type-shifting. Among the topics she considers are the interpretation of proper names, the mass-count distinction, the weak-strong interpretation of quantifiers, partitive and measure phrases, and the structural representation of the definite article. In the process she explores inter-language variation through the properties of the morpho-phonological system. The languages discussed include English, Chinese, Italian, and Hebrew.},

I will argue that a closerexamination of a broader range of linguistic facts raises serious problems for thisanalysis and instead favours a Russellian `multiple relations analysis' (which hasgenerally been discarded because of its apparent obvious linguistic implausibility).The resulting account can be given independent philosophical motivations within anintentionalist view of truth and predication.},

Guided by novel data from the Nilotic language Dinka Bor (South Sudan), I apply this view to three kinds of movement: A-movement, A-movement, and intermediate movement steps of successive-cyclic dependencies. In addition, I present a novel argument, from patterns of pronoun copying, that all phrasal movement arises from Merge.},

  Abstract                 = {{SQUIBS} {AND} {DISCUSSION} 303 {DP} {IS} {NOT} A {SCOPE} {ISLAND} Uli Sauerland Zentrum fu�r allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft 1 The Issue This squib is concerned with inverse linking constructions. May (1977) introduced this term for cases where a quantificational {DP} occurs inside another {DP} and takes wider scope than the containing {DP}. The construction is illustrated in (1), where every linguist is an argument of book, but takes wider scope than one book by t on the most salient interpretation. (1) Tom read [{cQP} one book by [{iQP} every linguist]]. In the following, I use the terms {iQP} and {cQP} for the inversely linked, contained {QP} and the containing {QP}, respectively. My use of the two terms is indicated in (1). For concreteness, I furthermore assume that syntactic movement, specifically Quantifier Raising ({QR}), is the only scope-changing mechanism. May (1977) proposed that in inverse linking, the {iQP} (everylinguist in (1)) undergoes {QR} to take clausal scope at {VP} (in the framework May was assuming, the {iQP} actually took scope at S). This {LF} structure is shown in (2). (2) {TP} {VPTom} {DP}1 {VP} every linguist read {DP} one {NP} book {PP} by t1 I am grateful for the useful comments I received on earlier versions of this material from Danny Fox; from audiences at {ESCOL} �99 at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, at {McGill} University in Montreal, and at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science in Lyon; and from one of the reviewers. The German Research Council ({DFG}) is currently supporting me as an {EmmyNoether}-Fellow (Grant {SA} 925/1-1), and at the time of writing I was enjoying the hospitality of the University of Tokyo and the University of Tsukuba. All remaining errors in this squib are solely my responsibility. 304 {SQUIBS} {AND} {DISCUSSION} Today, however, a different analysis of inverse linking is almost universally accepted. May himself proposes, in his 1985 book, that {DP} is an island for {QR}. The inversely linked interpretation of (1) is, on this proposal, derived from the structure in (3). (3) {TP} {VPTom} read {DP} every linguist {DP}1 {DP} one {NP} book {PP} by t1 Rooth (1985:117�118) and Larson (1985b) propose the same analysis of inverse linking, though with a different scope-taking mechanism. The {DP}-adjunction analysis is also adopted by Heim and Kratzer (1998:232�233) and, with a different scope-taking mechanism, by Barker (2002). May and Bale (2002) provide an accessible discussion of the analyses by May (1985) and Larson (1985b). Representation (3) requires some version of type-shifting to be interpretable since the sister of the {iQP} is of type H20855e, H20855H20855e, {tH}20856, {tH}20856H20856 while {iQP} itself is of type H20855H20855e, {tH}20856, {tH}20856. (Rooth and Heim and Kratzer provide concrete implementations of the type shift.) In this squib, I argue that May�s (1977) {TP}-adjunction analysis of inverse linking is required, which entails that {DP} cannot be an island for {QR}. Specifically, I show that the {iQP} can take scope separate from the {cQP} when scope relative to a scope-taking verb or scope relative to negation is considered. I look at these two phenomena in sections 2 and 3. In section 4, I discuss Larson�s (1985b) finding concerning the scope of {iQP} and {cQP} relative to a third {QP} that is the main argument for the adjunction-to-{DP} analysis. 2 Intensional Verbs The study of examples containing three quantificational elements requires great care. I first introduce the tests for wide and narrow scope {SQUIBS} {AND} {DISCUSSION} 305 of a {QP} relative to the verb want and then apply them to inverse linking. It is well known that indefinites provide a good test for narrow scope relative to an intensional verb. Consider (4). (4) John wants to marry someone from Spain. (4) has two distinct scopal construals. On one reading (sometimes called the de dicto reading), marrying any person from Spain would satisfy John�s desires. This construal allows (4) to be true in a situation where John does not know anybody from Spain. For this reading, the indefinite someone from Spain must take scope below want, since there is no single person such that John holds the desire to...},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues against the view that Hindi has a single strategy of relativization, traditionally referred to as the correlative construction, which is typologically distinct from relativization in languages like English. It is shown that Hindi, in fact, has two types of relative clauses which are syntactically and semantically distinct. Hindi embedded and right-adjoined relative clauses are generated inside {NP} and function like noun modifiers. They are similar in essential respects to restrictive relative clauses in English. Hindi left-adjoined relative clauses, on the other hand, are adjoined to {IP} at D-structure. They do not function like noun modifiers but are quantificational expressions binding variables inside their scope domain. It is suggested that left-adjoined relatives belong typologically with free relatives in English and internally-headed relatives in Quechua, since they have certain significant properties in common with these constructions.},

@phdthesis{uegaki_interpreting_2015,
  abstract =     {Abstract This dissertation concerns three kinds of variability
                  that pose challenges for the compositional semantics of
                  question-embedding sentences: (i) lexical variation among
                  clause-embedding predicates with respect to the selection of
                  complement types, (ii) variability in the exhaustivity of
                  embedded questions and (iii) variability in the veridicality
                  of embedded questions. Based on the proposal that declarative
                  complements of question-embedding predicates are limiting
                  cases of embedded questions, this dissertation presents a
                  compositional-semantic analysis of question embedding
                  sentences that can correctly predict the three kinds of
                  variability above. According to the proposal, the complement
                  selection is determined solely by the semantic type of the
                  embedding predicate. The variability in exhaustivity and
                  veridicality of embedded questions follows from a unified
                  semantic derivation, namely one involving exhaustification at
                  the matrix level once the lexical semantics of the embedding
                  predicate is taken into account.},
